                            Funzpoints is a unique operator that has developed its own in-house games. Woopla, the company that owns and operates Funzpoints, is behind the game collection at the casino. The games are quite fair, with an RTP rate of 96% and above. <br /> <br />

The Funzpoints Casino slots can either be played for fun or for cash prizes. The social casino slot games can be found in the standard Funzpoints mode, and all wins acquired in this mode are purely virtual wins. They do not hold any value for redemption. However, with premium funzpoints, the same slots will give you cash prize winnings. The premium mode gives you access to more exciting slot titles that could potentially give you real money wins. <br /> <br />

You can dive into a thrilling adventure with an adventure junky friend Kongo in the game Kongo’s adventure. This is a 20-line reel game that is packed with free spin bonuses and a safari adventure theme. Balloon Pop is another exciting  sweepstake slot game at Funzpoints that takes players deep into the balloon popping world. It is also a 20-line reel slot with great free spins. <br /> <br />

This is just a snippet of the incredible sweepstake slot games that you will find at Funzpoints. There are other exciting unique games at the casino as well – such as Paintball Keno, for example.<br /><br />

                            There are 2 ways you can take part in the Funzpoints sweepstake slot games. You can play for fun using the standard Funzpoints, virtual credits. You can alternatively purchase credits in the premium mode, where you can potentially win real money. <br /> <br />
 
                            You can acquire standard Funzpoints credits by emailing the Funzpoints support for additional virtual credits or simply acquire them by spinning the lucky wheel every 3 hours. Additionally, you are allowed to purchase the standard Funzpoints. Remember, the wins you get from wagering the standard Funzpoints cannot be converted into real money. To play the sweepstake games for real money, you will need to purchase standard Funzpoints. While doing so, you will get a few premium Funzpoints that can be played and redeemed for real money.<br /> <br />

                            The main idea behind social casinos is entertainment. While it is possible to win real money at sweepstakes casinos, their sole intention is to give you a platform for fun. At Funzpoints, the standard mode allows you to enjoy gaming for free. The virtual tokens in the standard mode will give you access to a limited number of game choices. If you want to gain access to all games, then you are going to have to switch to the premium mode, which is also the sweepstake aspect of Funzpoints Casino. <br /><br />

                            The social casino aspect of Funzpoints is not complicated at all. You simply need standard Funzpoints to unlock the slot games meant for fun only. The slots available in the social casino are as entertaining as the game selection in the premium section. The only noticeable difference of the Funzpoints social casino is the limited game choice. <br /> <br />

                            It is possible to win cash prizes at Funzpoints when you play in the premium mode. While in the premium mode, you need to accumulate at least 2000 premium points to be allowed to redeem it for real money. The redeem button will activate in your user account once you hit the required minimum threshold for redeeming prizes. Once you hit the redeem button, then you will be prompted to choose your payment method. Your cash prize will be processed through PaySafe or American Express. <br /> <br />

                            Every qualifying 100 premium funzpoints is valued at $1. Therefore, going by the numbers, the minimum acceptable cash prize that you can get is $20.<br /> <br />

                            <p className="para-data-area">
                            Funzpoints does not have a contact number. In fact, the casino does not offer phone support at all. The only available customer support communication channel is the email address. If you have any dispute, complaints or comments, then you can reach the casino by sending an email with all the necessary attachment for further assistance. <br /> <br />

                            Remember to check through the FAQ and the terms and Conditions section for a solution before you proceed to contact the Funzpoints support. <br /> <br />

                            While email support may seem like a slow contact method, Funzpoints promises to provide the necessary response in less than an hour. <br /> <br />

                            No, it is not. Our Funzpoints fraud review has dug deep into the gaming services at the casino to establish that it is a legit casino, offering trustworthy games and services. The casino does not force its customers to make any purchases to play at the casino, and neither does it state that players are guaranteed a win once they choose to play for cash prizes. <br /> <br />

                            Funzpoints is a social and sweepstake casino that is licensed to offer gambling services by the government of the United States of America. Being a license holder, the casino is obligated by the law to offer legitimate services with so much transparency and that is exactly what Funzpoints offers.<br /> <br />

                            No, you do not need to download any software to play at the casino. You simply need to login to your account, choose your preferred game and click play. It is important to note that you can only play at the casino if you have standard funzpoints, usually acquired by contact support, or by spinning the Funzwheel after every 3 hours. <br /> <br />

                            Mobile users also do not need to download any kind of software to play. They just need to visit the Funzpoints website and play all their favourite Funzpoints titles on the go.<br /> <br />

                            Yes, there are about 80 sweeps game options at the Funzpoints Casino. To obtain any winnings from the sweeps games, you are required to play them in the Funzpoints premium mode to win premium funzpoints that you can redeem for real cash prizes.<br /> <br />
