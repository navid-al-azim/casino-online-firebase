                            This online casino primarily offers slots. As the name suggests, this is a slot casino. All the slots at LuckyLand Slots Casino are proprietary titles.

                            However, they do come with a wide variety of exciting themes, fantastic graphics, and special features. For instance, there are unique sweepstakes slot titles like Snow Queen and Mayan Gold, which are some fan-favorites. <br /> <br />

                            This online casino does provide a social element to their casinoâ€™s gameplay.

                            LuckyLand Slots is not your typical online casino, and you need to deposit money into your casino account to start playing. It is a social casino. This means that you can play for free. However, some requirements still apply. <br /> <br />

                            For instance, you have to register with the social casino. Afterwards, you can claim the welcome bonus which includes virtual cash known as Gold coins and Sweeps coins. You will need this virtual cash to play the games on the platform. <br /> <br />

                            Besides the welcome offer, there are several other bonuses where you will receive these virtual currencies so you can keep playing for free. You can also use real money to purchase virtual coins. However, you are not allowed to play with real money.<br /> <br />

                            LuckyLand Slots is not a regular online casino where you can start playing by depositing money into your account and then use the money to place bets and play casino games. Instead, this platform operates on a sweepstakes model. This means that players have the chance to play all the games on LuckyLand Slots for free. <br /> <br />

                            There are virtual coins that players get in the form of bonuses that are used instead of real money. They come in the form of Sweeps Coins and Gold Coins. Sweeps Coins are redeemable for real cash. However, you cannot purchase them. The only way to get them is by claiming bonuses offered by the online casino. <br /> <br />

                            On the other hand, the casino still offers Gold Coins as bonuses. However, you can purchase them with real money. So, when it comes to payment methods on LuckyLand Slots, they are not applied like on regular casinos. Instead of using the payment methods to deposit real money into your casino account, you use them to purchase gold coins. <br /> <br />

                            This platform accepts secure and instant payment methods for purchasing gold coins. For instance, you can use cards, eWallets, and bank transfers. The online casino does not charge any fees for purchasing gold coins using these payment methods.  <br /> <br />

                            The accepted payment methods also come in handy when you want to redeem your sweeps coins for real money. The conversion rate is one Sweeps Coin per US dollar. <br />

                            We have mentioned severally in this post that LuckyLand Slots is a social casino. Allow us to explain what this means. A social casino is a gambling platform that allows gamblers to play casino games without spending any real money. <br /> <br />

                            These platforms are mandated by the law to provide ways for players to participate in casino gaming without the financial and social risks. They aim at preventing financial constraints and other gambling-related challenges like addictions. <br /> <br />

                            LuckyLand Slots earns the title of a social casino because of the use of virtual currencies instead of real cash. The site offers many bonuses through which players can earn virtual currencies and use them to play casino games. This way, players do not feel the need to spend money on purchasing virtual coins so they can play the games.<br /> <br />

                            Known in full as the Return To Player rate, this represents the average amount of money a casino game pays back to players over time. For instance, with an RTP of 96%, every $1 wager will return $0.96 back to players over a long period. The rest of the amount goes to the casino because the platform has to make money in the long run. <br /> <br />

                            However, the exact RTP is a long-term average and not short-term. This rate usually differs from one software provider to the next. The casino may also play a role in determining the RTP. <br /> <br />

                            The concept of RTP does not apply at LuckyLand Slots. This is because players do not use real money to play on LuckyLand Slots. Also, the games are not standard casino games developed by industry software providers who usually determine the RTP of a game. The platform does not indicate if its games have an RTP attached to them.<br /> <br />
