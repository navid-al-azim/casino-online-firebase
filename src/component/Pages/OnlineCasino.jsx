              <p>
                While not all our reviews are positive, we only list casinos
                that we deem to be safe and secure. It goes without saying that
                all our listed casinos have a valid UK Gambling Commission
                licence and a track record of timely, reliable payouts. In one
                sense we are reasonably lucky that we have a highly regulated
                marketplace in which some of the worst excesses practised by
                online casinos in unregulated markets are not allowed and
                responsible gambling is taken extremely seriously. So the worst
                casinos have been shut down or had licenses revoked. Well-known
                brands need to be consumer-friendly and be vigilant on
                responsible gambling so there is a degree of brand protection
                going too. You can learn more behind some of the people who work
                tirelessly behind the scenes to bring you the best results at
                the ‘about us‘ page.

                    One of the key things most of us want to know about a casino
                    before signing up is the type of welcome bonus offers they
                    have available. With our easy to use casino filtering system
                    and our great Telegram Channel, you can search for the
                    perfect welcome offer. <br />
                    <br />
                    Whether it’s low wagering requirements, high % match or
                    simply a large cash amount that you are after you’ll be able
                    to sort and search our casinos on any of these elements. Our
                    comparison will provide a superior, well-structured list of
                    all available Free Spins No Deposit, Casino Cashback Offers
                    and Casino Promo Codes. <br /> <br />
                    We will be adding new online casinos on a regular basis so
                    it’s always worth coming back to us to look for new
                    operators when you fancy a change from your existing casino
                    provider. We update all our bonus information continually in
                    our database so we only ever show the most up to date

                    ICasino design and usability
                  </p>

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    With so many casinos offering the same games and similar
                    promos, design and usability can be an important way to make
                    a casino stand out from the crowd. On very good example for
                    excellent design and usability is the BC Game Casino. <br />{" "}
                    <br />
                    So it’s strange that so many casinos are still so poorly
                    designed. Some of the smaller sites you’ll find may not have
                    too much choice other than to follow the template of a
                    software provider, however, the bigger players normally will
                    have complete control over everything from games interface,
                    to live chat to the cashier. <br /> <br />
                    Admittedly the standard of design and usability has been
                    raised in recent times mainly by a glut of new Scandinavian
                    casinos that have taken the time and effort to think about
                    design. This in turn has risen the standard and we are
                    seeing improvements across the industry. <br /> <br />
                    This is an area we focus on in our reviews, but it is
                    somewhat subjective so you’ll be the best judge of what you
                    like and what you don’t like.
                    <br /> <br />
                  </p>
                </div>

              <div className="facts">

                    Casino game selection
                  </p>

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    Game selection is another extremely important aspect of
                    reviewing a casino – many players have software providers
                    that they see as essential to an enjoyable gambling
                    experience. Many people love to play online roulette for
                    example. For this reason, we allow you to filter the casinos
                    on this site by game software – so if Starburst is an
                    absolute must for you, simply filter casinos on NetEnt and
                    you’ll see all the casinos that will carry that game. <br />{" "}
                    <br />
                    Because there is so much choice now and so many different
                    game providers some players look for a quality curation of
                    games from their casino. It’s no good having 2000 games
                    on-site if most of them are old, unplayable and not up to
                    today’s standards. Some casinos are doing a good job of this
                    – getting lots of game providers on board but only
                    publishing the real quality. Also, trending games like Crash
                    Gambling is an important feature, that Casino.online will
                    cover frequently.

                    Can Mobile casino product

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    Quality mobile casino product is essential to a modern
                    online casinos survival. All casinos now have a mobile
                    product and many are thinking in a ‘mobile-first’ was as
                    over 50% of casino play and revenue now comes from mobile
                    casino rather than desktop/laptop. <br /> <br />
                    A decent mobile product should do everything a desktop
                    product does without trying to copy it exactly. Things must
                    be done slightly differently on mobile, it’s a smaller
                    space, so design work needs to take this into account and
                    make games and interface features just as usable on mobile.
                    Most casinos are getting there with this and it’s rare to
                    see very poor mobile sites these days, but some casinos
                    certainly do a better job than others.

                    Progressive Jackpots
                  </p>

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    Right from the start, online casinos have grabbed headlines
                    for the huge progressive jackpots on offer. At the start of
                    the industry, people found it hard to believe that such
                    giant jackpots were possible to win online. At one of the
                    casino operator offices, a casino customer refused to
                    believe that he had won £8.5million until the cheque had
                    cleared in his bank account. <br /> <br />
                    These days with a few more years behind the industry and
                    casinos much more common progressive jackpots are much more
                    commonplace and all the major software providers include at
                    least one progressive jackpot of a decent size as part of
                    their package and casinos consider jackpots an essential
                    part of their gaming mix. <br /> <br />
                    Progressive slots are not typically suited for daily play
                    due to their lower payout ratios, usually between 90-95%,
                    compared to the standard 96% or higher for non-progressive
                    slots. With top games like Playtech’s Jackpot Giant,
                    Microgaming’s Mega Moolah, and NetEnt’s Mega Fortune readily
                    accessible at UK casinos, players have many options for
                    chasing those substantial jackpots.

                    Casino Payout Ratios & RTPs
                  </p>

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    Not all Casinos publish their payout rates, however, all UK
                    licensed casinos are required to be audited in order to keep
                    their license. If the payout ratio is published we’ll list
                    it here on-site as part of our review of the casino. <br />{" "}
                    <br />
                    There are other ways of knowing what the expected payout
                    will be on particular games at your selected casino. Some
                    game developers will include RTP in their game pay tables
                    and frequently casino sites publish RTPs for particular
                    games on their site. In many ways, it’s most important to
                    know the payout for the games you are playing rather than an
                    overall payout for the casino as your expectations as a
                    player will be very different depending on whether you like
                    progressive jackpot slots or online blackjack. <br /> <br />

                    Responsible gambling advocacy
                  </p>

                  <p className="para-data-area">
                    It is now a given that UK Casinos must comply with the
                    Gambling Commission’s rules on responsible gambling. There
                    are all kinds of rules in place around marketing, in-play
                    and customer service that online casinos must follow – this
                    has made the online gambling environment, safer for players
                    and stopped unscrupulous operators taking advantage of
                    players. <br /> <br />
                    Responsible gambling starts before customers even sign up to
                    casinos – with rules around advertising. Advertising cannot
                    appeal to under-18s or use anyone in the advert who looks
                    under 25. Significant terms must always be displayed when
                    showing an offer online and adverts must be placed only in
                    socially responsible places that adults visit. <br /> <br />
                    Once a player has signed up to a casino and started playing
                    easy access to account information such as gambling history,
                    deposit info and the ability to set deposits with limits or
                    there are casinos with no limit, but must all be in place
                    for UK-based operators. Casinos must also promote the site
                    begambleaware.org – this gives players detailed information
                    about recognising gambling problems, and staying in control
                    and offers help and support to those players who feel that
                    gambling has stopped being fun anymore. <br /> <br />
                    We would only consider casinos that comply with all of the
                    above and have a decent record of responsible gambling – a
                    casino should look out for their players’ well-being as well
                    as provide a quality casino product. <br /> <br />

                  What are the best online casinos?

                <p className="para-data-area">
                  Pretty much everyone asks this question when they first start
                  gambling – what are the best online casino sites in the UK?
                  Unfortunately, there is no one solid answer that we can give
                  you. There isn’t one casino we can pointto and say yep, that’s
                  the one you should go to, for sure! After all, you can spend
                  all day recommending the best sushi restaurant to someone, and
                  they’ll still think you’re a liar if they don’t like fish.{" "}
                  <br />
                  We’ve made it a point to showcase the top online casinos,
                  review them and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, but
                  we can’t tell you which one you’re going to enjoy most. Only
                  you can answer that. If you’re looking for a UK online casino
                  site with a strong deposit bonus, you might end up with a
                  different choice than if you’re looking for a great live
                  dealer experience. Not even the best UK casino sites are
                  masters of all. <br /> <br />
                  That’s why it’s super important to read our reviews carefully
                  and use them as a base to determine where to sign up. If
                  you’re interested in decent online casino bonuses (for example
                  a 100% welcome bonus), your prime destination should be the
                  bonus section of our review. And if you’re judging them based
                  on what online casino games they offer, you could take a look
                  at our pages for the respective games, which will only list UK
                  online casinos that contain those games.

                  First hand experience is really the only way you can truly

                  customer service, withdrawal times and the games on offer for
                  yourself will truly determine the level of trust you
                  personally place at a particular online casino. <br />
                  However, there are of course ways to get a good sense of which
                  casinos you can trust via this site and you don’t have to
                  believe solely our opinion either as we collate ratings from
                  lots of casino sites and also invite reader to give their
                  ratings also. <br />
                  Read our reviews, check the casinos credentials within those
                  reviews, check out the ratings that we collate from around the
                  web, check readers opinion of the casino and armed with these
                  three differing sources of info you should be able to choose
                  which casinos are most trustworthy and therefore deserving of
                  your custom.

                <p className="para-data-area">
                The Casino.online team have extensive knowledge of working at online casino operators and we have never experienced any of them closing player casino accounts for winning. This sort of practice does happen in Sportsbetting where accounts are profiled and limited when winning on particular sports, but not at Casinos. <br />

Ultimately the Casino is operating at an edge (check the payout rate of your online casino before you start playing) and the owners of these casinos know this. Winning is the main reason players will play at a casino so it’s very important winners are looked after and celebrated in the same way all customers are.

                If by the term ‘beat’ we mean ‘win’ at an online casino, then yes, you can absolutely win at casino – huge progressive jackpots are won every day, players walk away with small wins on the blackjack or roulette tables or someone hits the top win on a slot machine and those that are smart walk away with their winnings! <br />

Playing games that have the smallest house edge will give you the best chance of winning in the long run, but if you’re looking for a big win then a high volatility slot with big payouts could be the game for you – the wins will be less frequent, and you may find your bank roll depleted but you never know a big win may come your way.
