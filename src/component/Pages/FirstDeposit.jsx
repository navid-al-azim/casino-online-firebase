              WHAT ARE FIRST DEPOSIT CASINO BONUSES?
              </h2>
              <p>
               
              Online casino bonuses come in many forms. With the ever expanding number of online casinos, the competition to attract new players and retain existing players requires online casinos to offer players bonuses for depositing and playing at the casino site. <br /> <br />

The casino welcome bonus is where it all begins for new players at an online casino. Casino operators offer an array of different casino bonuses to entice players to their platform such as a No Deposit Bonus, Match Deposit Bonus or a Free Spins Bonus. <br /> <br />

A first deposit bonus, as the title suggests, is one that is given to new customers when they deposit their funds for the first time. Normally, an online casino will offer to match a certain percentage of their new players’ first deposit. <br /> <br />

It is worth mentioning that the percentage that the online casino matches often differs from one casino to another. Therefore, you should not go into online gambling expecting a 100% match from all online casino sites. Furthermore, a sign up promotion can be applied to the first 3 deposits that are made to the casino. <br /> <br />

All online casino bonuses including first deposit bonuses come with specific terms and conditions, including wagering requirements, which must be fulfilled before any associated winnings can be withdrawn. Many bonuses also have other restrictions such as time validity, minimum deposit and maximum winnings that can be withdrawn. <br /> <br />

                  HOW DO CASINOS MAKE MONEY ON WELCOME BONUSES?
                </p>

                <p className="para-data-area">
                Firstly, online casinos make money on welcome bonuses by attracting new players. These casino bonuses act as incentives to attract new players and maintain the existing ones. So, the more players the casino sites attract, the more money they are likely to make. <br />

Also, a sign up bonus encourage players to start playing as soon as they join the platform. The amount that the casino offers are usually small compared to what they will make when the players play their games and place wagers. Welcome bonuses also help online casinos stand out from their competition, which promotes more signups and more money in the long run.
