                <p className="para-data-area">
                Funrize Casino offers a small but exciting collection of over 70 games for sweepstakes. Players can click on the gameâ€™s icon on the left-hand sidebar to explore impressive Funrize casino slots, fish games, and jackpot games. There are various themes, so each player will find something suitable to keep them interested for hours. Some outstanding slot games include Carnival Cat, Book of the Nile, and Fortune Skulls. <br /> <br />

                Players will be happy to discover they can play all slot games with tournament coins issued for free on registration. Still, all other games are reserved for the premium mode. Live casino games, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat are not available in this sweepstakes casino, so players in the free-play mode are getting all the benefits.
                <br /> <br />

                Under the Fishing menu, players can choose the Fishing Kingdom and the Thunder Fishing games. These games require a player to purchase some coins to claim prizes when they win the games. Fishing games are thrilling because they can involve four players simultaneously. <br /> <br />

                An outstanding feature of the games available for sweepstakes is that they have information on the potential risk, in-game multipliers, and play level limits. Players can choose games with a low risk of depleting their Tournament coins or promotional entries.<br /> <br />

                <p className="para-data-area">
                Suppose you are a new player participating in Funrize Casino Sweepstakes. In that case, you must be a resident of any of the 47 states in the U.S. that allow social casinos. Funrize does not operate in Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming. <br /> <br />

                You need to register an account using your Google account, Facebook, email, or phone number to receive the no-deposit welcome offer of 75,000 tournament coins. After signing up, go to the games lobby, choose a game, and begin playing. <br /> <br />

                This free-to-play mode is just for fun and sharpening your skills. The Casino gives you more tournament coins to explore more games after you verify your email, phone number and complete your profile. You must accumulate promotional entries issued when you purchase more tournament coins to claim prizes. <br /> <br />

                </p>

                <p className="para-data-area">
                All social casinos donâ€™t allow gambling with real money, so they have virtual coins. Funrize Casino offers players two virtual tokens, tournament coins (T.R.N.), and promotional entries. T.R.N. is a free virtual currency that can be purchased using real funds. Donâ€™t forget to check out the Funrize bonus, and get more info! <br /> <br />

                After signing up, Funrize offers players 125,000 TRN and more every day. These coins can only be used in tournament or free-play modes as they have no real-world value and cannot be used to win prizes. You may have the chance of scoring a fantastic welcome bonus though! <br /> <br />

                Promotional entries (P.E.s) are the real-play virtual currency issued with every purchase of tournament coins using real money or other alternative methods. Players use promotional entries to play Funrize promotional games in the promotional mode. <br /> <br />

                Players can redeem the promotional entries for gift cards, cash prizes, or more tournament coins. Funrize Casino has a switch button at the top of the website, making switching between the promotional and tournament modes quick. <br /> <br />

                </p>

                <p className="para-data-area">
                Funrize Casino is an entirely free-to-play casino where players receive free tournament coins to play their favorite games for fun in the tournament mode. The Casino also has a real-play or promotional mode, where players can use real money to purchase tournament coins with promotional entries. <br /> <br />

                Funrize Casino offers a few reliable payment options for players who need to boost their T.R.N. These methods include credit or debit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, and Discover and online banking transfers through Trustly and Apple Pay. <br /> <br />

                E-wallets and cryptocurrencies are not yet allowed at Funrize Casino, but it is understandable as the Casino is more of a fun play platform than a gambling site. The cost of T.R.N. coins ranges from $4.99 to $199.99, depending on the playerâ€™s preference. <br /> <br />

                Transactions with the available banking options are instant, and a player will receive their T.R.N. coins and promotional entries as soon as they choose a banking method and complete the transaction. <br /> <br />

                Once players meet the minimum withdrawal limit of $25 for cash prizes, they can select a payment option to receive their funds. $1 equals 100 promotional entries; a player needs a minimum of 2500 entries to claim a cash prize. <br /> <br />
