                          <p className="para-data-area">
                          The standard virtual tokens used at Crown Coins Casino are referred to as coins. This sweepstakes casino used two types of coins: Gold Coins (GC) and Sweeps Coins (SC). You will use the Gold Coins to play the games, and they are freely given to you by the casino after you create your account. Gold Coins can also be purchased on the various packages offered by Crown Coins. <br /> <br />

The Sweeps Coins are only awarded by the sweepstakes casino and cannot be bought. When you complete the account registration and verification process you get 100000Coins and 2 Sweeps Coins. These are two standard amounts you get, but you can get even more when you opt for additional features. This means that you stand to get more Gold Coins if you opt for email address notifications.

                          <p className="para-data-area">
                          It is true that you can play at a sweepstakes casino without making a purchase. This system works because the sweepstakes casino awards players with plenty of Gold Coins and a few Sweeps Coins. So, what happens if you want to try out a particular game that demands more Gold Coins than you have? <br /> <br />

                            You purchased more from the coin store. This is the reason why even though sweepstakes casinos offer free play, they also have different payment methods. Crown Coins Casino has ensured that you are covered when you need to make a purchase or receive a redeemed prize. You can utilize various bank transfers, credit cards, and digital transfers to remit funds to your account. <br /> <br />

                            The main purchase and redemption methods at Crown Coins Casino include Visa, American Express, Apple Pay, Discover, MasterCard and Skrill. These payment methods are secure and ensure that you get your money in good time. Before you settle on a payment method, check the transaction limits and processing fees. Some payment methods charge a withdrawal fee, while others don’t. You will also find that certain purchase and redemption methods take longer to avail the funds to your account than others. After you assess your needs, pick a method that works for you. <br /> <br />

You should read the casino’s guidelines as you are creating the account to ensure that you are aware of the ramifications of closing your account. Players close their accounts as part of the self-exclusion program if they feel that they have a gambling addiction. <br /> <br />

Start by contacting the support team via live chat or a phone call, and they will guide you on the account deletion process. You will need to enter the relevant details, including your username and other login credentials and then offer proof of identification. A representative will contact you to verify your details and confirm the account deactivation. Once the account closure is confirmed, your account will be declared inactive, and you can no longer access or use it.<br /> <br />
