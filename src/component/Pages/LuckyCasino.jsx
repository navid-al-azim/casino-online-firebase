                        There are about 150 games offered at Lucky Bird Casino. The games include slot games, arcade games, video poker, roulette, and blackjack.

However, the few available games offer great graphics and innovative game play features. Some of the unique titles, titles at Luckybird Casino include Legends of Zeus, Stone Age, Rich Panda, and Ice Queen.

                        <p className="para-data-area">
                        This is a platform that offers casino-style games for fun. This means that you can participate in the games without risking your real money. Instead, you use in-game currencies. <br /> <br />

At Luckybird Casino, there are in-game currencies called gold coins (GC) that you can use to play casino games without risking your real cash. These coins can be obtained through bonuses or cryptocurrencies. Even though you can play these games without real money, you still get the chance to win money that you can redeem for real cash. <br /> <br />

However, it also depends on the type of virtual currencies you win. For instance, at Luckybird, you cannot exchange gold coins for real cash prizes. Instead, if you use sweepstake cash, you can redeem your winnings for either real money prizes or crypto prizes. At Luckybird sweepstakes, you need a minimum of 20 sweepstake cash to redeem them for cryptos. <br />

                        <p className="para-data-area">
                        There are two types of virtual currencies at Luckybird sweepstakes. They are: <br />

Gold coins (GC)â€“ these are coins that are obtained through the Luckybird social casino bonus or by purchase. You can purchase the coins using cryptocurrencies. The coins allow you to participate in all games within the casinoâ€™s collection. Wagering with gold coins lets you experience the excitement of winning, just like what happens at traditional casinos. However, the winnings you achieve from playing with gold coins cannot be withdrawn. You can only continue using the coins to play more games. <br /> <br />

Sweepstake cash (SC)â€“ these are virtual tokens that are exclusively earned through promotions, casino victories, and bonuses you get when you purchase more gold coins. What stands out about these coins is the fact that you can exchange them for real cash prizes. Since Luckybird only transacts with cryptocurrencies, you can exchange your SC for cryptocurrency prizes. At Luckybird you need at least 20 SC so you can redeem it into cryptos. <br /> <br />

                        <p className="para-data-area">
                        Luckybird does not support traditional reputable payment methods, it instead accepts various crypto payment options. You can pay at Luckybird with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (LTC), Dogecoin, and Litecoin (ETH) meaning that you need a crypto wallet for the specific cryptocurrency you want to transact in. The same payment methods are applied for withdrawals at Luckybird sweepstakes. <br /> <br />

It is worth mentioning that you cannot play at Luckybird with the real money you deposit. Instead, you can use the cryptos you deposit into your Luckybird account to purchase gold coins. The price of the gold coins is indicated in dollars. So, it is up to you to convert the price into cryptos according to the current price and the market cap. For instance, the price of 100,000 gold coins is $10 (convert to your preferred crypto). <br /> <br />

                        Social casinos have a difference to real money casinos. A social casino is a gambling platform that provides free-to-play games. These are games that you do not have to spend money to play but they still offer the thrill of online gambling that you can receive at traditional casinos. <br /> <br />

At a social casino, there is no winning or losing as the gameplay is for fun. So, players do not have to worry about the monetary risks, or social, religious, or moral implications, of gambling. At Luckybird, there is a social casino where you can choose to play without risking any money. <br /> <br />

Instead of real money, at Luckybird Social Casino, you can play using virtual currencies. The gold coins at Luckybird can be acquired from bonuses. There are many bonuses and promotions at Luckybird where gold coins are offered so that you do not have to spend real money. <br /> <br />
